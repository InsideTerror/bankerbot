**Effective Date:** November 1, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how BankerBot (“the Bot”, “we”, “our”, “us”) collects, uses, and protects information from users and Discord servers that interact with it.  
By using the Bot, you consent to the data practices described below.

## 1. Information We Collect
BankerBot only collects data that is **strictly necessary** for its functionality:

### **1.1 Discord Data**
We collect and temporarily store:
- **Server information:** Server ID, name, and configuration data.  
- **User information:** User ID, username, and roles (only for permissions or audit logs).  
- **Economy data:** Currency names, exchange rates, balances, and transfer logs.  
- **Application data:** Guild requests to join or leave the global market, including timestamps and approvers.  

We **do not** collect message contents or any personally identifiable information (PII).

### **1.2 Technical Data**
For security and analytics, we may collect:
- Command usage timestamps and errors.  
- Bot uptime, version, and error logs.  
- IP address of the hosting environment (not end users).

## 2. How We Use the Data
We use your data solely for:
- Managing server registration in the **global economy system**.  
- Performing automatic economy synchronization and conversions between servers.  
- Auditing actions such as approvals, denials, or currency updates.  
- Displaying user or server information within economy commands.  
- Ensuring system security and stability.

We **never sell, rent, or share** your data with third parties.

## 3. Data Retention
- **Active servers:** Data is retained while the bot remains in your server.  
- **Opt-out or removal:** When the bot leaves a server or `/economy withdraw` is executed, all related data (guild + economy) is permanently deleted from local storage.  
- **Error and audit logs:** Retained for a maximum of **30 days** for troubleshooting before automatic deletion.

---

## 4. Data Sharing
BankerBot interacts with **UnbelievaBoat’s public API** to read and update economy data.  
We share only:
- The Guild ID, User ID, and balance information required to perform those operations.

All communication with UnbelievaBoat is encrypted via HTTPS and subject to their [Privacy Policy](https://unbelievaboat.com/privacy).

## 5. Security
We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data:
- All database access is restricted to the bot process only.  
- No personal information is transmitted unencrypted.  
- Access to bot hosting and source code is limited to verified developers.

However, no system is 100% secure. By using the Bot, you acknowledge that data transmission over the internet carries inherent risks.

Depending on your jurisdiction (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), you have the right to:
- Request deletion of your server’s data.
